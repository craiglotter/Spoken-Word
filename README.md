Spoken Word
===========

This beta-version application basically just reads a Word document back to you using Microsoft's Speech Engine (Included in the installer). 

SpokenWord works best if you open the document first, and then open the application.  If you do it the other way around, youll have to click the find doc button until the doc is located.  You may also have to minimize/restore the Word doc before the app can see it. 

Once youve latched onto the document, you can start reading it.
